# Pedestrian-Behavior-Analysis-in-Traffic-
The project applies machine learning to analyze pedestrian behavior in traffic using regression, classification, and clustering. It predicts speed and acceleration, classifies safe vs. risky actions, and detects pedestrian clusters. The work supports urban planning, traffic safety, and autonomous vehicle systems.
